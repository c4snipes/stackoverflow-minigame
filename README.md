# stackoverflow-minigame

You’re a stack frame trying to climb higher without overflowing.

## Build and run

Requirements: .NET SDK (9.0 or later) installed. Verify with `dotnet --version`.

From the repository root:

1. Build:

   ```bash
   dotnet build
   ```

2. Run:

   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```

The project uses a single SDK-style project file `stackoverflow-minigame.csproj` in the repository root, and a solution file `stackoverflow-minigame.sln` is already included.
