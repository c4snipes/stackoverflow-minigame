**CSCI-310 Development Notebook**

-----
**Guideline:** 

- Please document all your development activities, whether you use any AI coding tool or not. You might mix your manual coding or AI tool usage. Just document the entire process. 
  - If this is a team project or assignment, list all team members’ names in the “Name” field. For each iteration, record the name of the person who contributed any part of the work in the “What do you do?” field.
- Any interactions with AI coding tools such as ChatGPT, Gemini, Copilot, and others must capture the full conversation history. 
- Use the format below to record your development activities in a clear and consistent manner. 
  - Adding more iteration sections if needed.
